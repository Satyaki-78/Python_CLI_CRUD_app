- The `dict` list at the top is a data structure to be made based on the mysql table in the database.
- The code will handle the CRUD operations on that table dynamically by making use of the list.
- I have yet to optimize the code more by creating an input checking function which only allows y and n.

## I will update the code and documentation properly a bit later as I am busy on other things, stay tuned
